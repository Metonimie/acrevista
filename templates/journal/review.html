            <p>The reviewing process involves the following stages:</p>
            <p>Receiving the paper in the required format and using the imposed technical instructions for authors; the
                full paper manuscript will be submitted electronically in PDF format; the editors will acknowledge the
                paper's arriving in good conditions, mark the date, and inform the authors about that.</p>
            <p>Within maximum 15 days the editors will nominate the referees and address the paper manuscript to them;
                peer reviewing will be accorded to each paper by three referees; in some cases the paper may be reviewed
                by two referees; in cases of uncertainty, the editorial board will discuss the paper and take the final
                decision upon publication.</p>
            <p>The referees will use a specific reviewing template; the paper may be recommended for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acceptance without any changes</strong>; in that case the authors will be asked to send the
                    paper
                    electronically in the required Microsoft Word DOC format according to the instructions for authors.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Acceptance with minor changes</strong>; if the authors follow the conditions imposed by
                    referees the paper
                    will be sent in the required Microsoft Word DOC format along with the answers to referees' comments
                    and with a list of revisions made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acceptance with major changes</strong>; if the authors follow completely the conditions
                    imposed by referees
                    the paper will be sent in the required Microsoft Word DOC format along with the answers to referees'
                    comments and with a list of revisions made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rejection</strong>; in that case the reasons for rejection will be transmitted to authors along with some
                    suggestions for future improvements (if that will be considered necessary).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> In all cases, the required changes will be transmitted to authors; the changes may be accepted totally
                or partially by the author(s); in the latter case, the referees' requirements may be challenged by the
                author(s) and the paper will be submitted for a second round of reviewing. </p>
            <p>The date of publishing acceptance will be communicated to author(s) and printed in the final part of the
                published paper. </p>
            <p>The final camera-ready format as requested by the editors has to be transmitted by authors within 30 days
                after the acceptance. Any special cases have to be adjusted according to editors' demands.</p>
